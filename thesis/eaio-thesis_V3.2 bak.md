## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Statement and Motivation

Building energy consumption accounts for approximately **40% of global energy usage** and represents a significant contributor to carbon emissions worldwide. Commercial and institutional buildings face increasing pressure to reduce energy consumption while maintaining operational efficiency and occupant comfort. Traditional Building Management Systems (BMS) rely on rule-based automation and reactive maintenance, limiting their ability to adapt to changing conditions and optimize energy usage proactively.

The complexity of modern building systems presents several challenges for energy management:

#### Data Complexity and Volume
Modern buildings generate vast amounts of data from various sensors, meters, and control systems. The **Building Data Genome Project 2 (BDG2)** dataset demonstrates this complexity with **53.6 million hourly measurements** from 3,053 energy meters across 1,636 non-residential buildings. This data volume overwhelms traditional analysis methods and requires sophisticated AI approaches with enterprise-grade observability to extract actionable insights.

#### Multi-stakeholder Decision Making
Building energy management involves multiple stakeholders with different expertise levels and priorities. Facility managers focus on operational efficiency, energy analysts require detailed technical analysis, and executives need strategic insights. Current systems lack the ability to provide contextual, role-appropriate information through natural language interaction with comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
