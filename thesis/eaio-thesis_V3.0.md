## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Statement and Motivation

Building energy consumption accounts for approximately **40% of global energy usage** and represents a significant contributor to carbon emissions worldwide. Commercial and institutional buildings face increasing pressure to reduce energy consumption while maintaining operational efficiency and occupant comfort. Traditional Building Management Systems (BMS) rely on rule-based automation and reactive maintenance, limiting their ability to adapt to changing conditions and optimize energy usage proactively.

The complexity of modern building systems presents several challenges for energy management:
