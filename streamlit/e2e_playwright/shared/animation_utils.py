    Parameters
    ----------
    app : Page
        The Playwright Page object representing the browser page.

        The Playwright Locator object for the element to check.

    Returns
    -------

        False if it's onscreen or not rendered.

    Notes
    -----
    The function checks if the element's bounding box is entirely
    outside the current viewport dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app : Page
        The Playwright Page object representing the browser page.

    Returns
    -------

    -----
